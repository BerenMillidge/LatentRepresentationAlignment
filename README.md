Basic replication of the algorithm from https://wvvw.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4389. LRA is a predictive coding-like algorithm which has performance comparable with backprop in supervised networks but trains in an entirely local manner while also avoiding the weight transport problem with different forward and backward weights.
